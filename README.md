Swift Projects

Currently no iOS projects posted on my github, sorry! I am a Student in an iOS Development course at Southern Utah University where I am working on a few Apps.

First app is a photo-sharing App similar to Instagram. I am working on this project by myself.

The other app is an RPG that we're working on as a group project. As I make progress on these apps I will post updates.
